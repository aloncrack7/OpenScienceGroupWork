Workflow Sketch:

1. Ingest the 30 research papers using Spark's data ingestion capabilities.
2. Preprocess the text data to clean and extract relevant information.
3. Apply a topic modeling algorithm to identify common themes within the research papers.
4. Group the papers based on their topics..
5. Construct a Research Knowledge Graph (RKG) using Spark's graph processing capabilities.
6. Extract metadata and funding information from the papers and link them to the corresponding nodes in the RKG.
7. Visualize the RKG and perform advanced data analysis using graph visualization tools and HuggingFace's models.
8. Generate insights and draw conclusions from the analysis.
